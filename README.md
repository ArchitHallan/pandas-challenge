# PyCitySchool Challenge

## Overview of the PyCitySchools Analysis
In order to present the school board with an overview of the district's important indicators, including student math and reading test scores, passing rates, and school budgets, this project will analyse school district data. Additionally, the study will provide light on how many elements, like school size and kind, impact student achievement.

## Step by step instructions on how to perform the analysis are as follows:

1. The district and school summary will be created.
2. The top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate, will be identified.
3. The average math score for each grade level from each school will be calculated.
4. The average reading score for each grade level from each school will be calculated.
5. The scores by school spending per student, by school size, and by school type will be calculated.
## Resources
- Data Source: schools_complete.csv, students_complete.csv
- Software: Python 3.7.6, Jupyter Notebook 6.0.3

## Results of the PyCitySchools Analysis 

The results of the analysis are as follows:

#### District Summary
The district summary shows that the district has a total of 39,170 students, 15 schools, and a total budget of $24,649,428. The average math score is 79.0 and the average reading score is 81.9. The overall passing rate is 65.2%.

#### School Summary
The school summary shows that the top performing school is Cabrera High School, with an overall passing rate of 91.3%. The bottom performing school is Rodriguez High School, with an overall passing rate of 52.9%.

#### Top Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)
The top performing schools are Cabrera High School, Thomas High School, Griffin High School, Wilson High School, and Pena High School.

#### Bottom Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)
The bottom performing schools are Rodriguez High School, Figueroa High School, Huang High School, Hernandez High School, and Johnson High School.

#### Math Scores by Grade 
The average math scores by grade are as follows:
- 9th grade: 78.9
- 10th grade: 78.9
- 11th grade: 79.1
- 12th grade: 79.0

#### Reading Scores by Grade
The average reading scores by grade are as follows:
- 9th grade: 81.9
- 10th grade: 81.9
- 11th grade: 81.9
- 12th grade: 81.9


#### Scores by School Spending
The average math score, average reading score, % passing math, % passing reading, and % overall passing by school spending are as follows:
- $0-585: 83.4, 83.9, 93.7, 96.7, 90.6
- $585-615: 83.5, 83.8, 94.1, 95.9, 90.6
- $615-645: 78.1, 81.4, 71.4, 83.6, 62.9
- $645-675: 77.0, 81.0, 66.2, 81.1, 53.5

#### Scores by School Size
The average math score, average reading score, % passing math, % passing reading, and % overall passing by school size are as follows:
- Small (<1000): 83.8, 83.9, 93.9, 96.1, 89.9
- Medium (1000-2000): 83.4, 83.9, 93.6, 96.8, 90.6
- Large (2000-5000): 77.7, 81.3, 70.0, 82.8, 58.3

#### Scores by School Type

The average math score, average reading score, % passing math, % passing reading, and % overall passing by school type are as follows:
- Charter: 83.5, 83.9, 93.6, 96.6, 90.4
- District: 77.0, 81.0, 66.5, 80.9, 53.7


## Summary and conclusions of the PyCitySchools Analysis
The analysis shows that the top performing schools are charter schools, while the bottom performing schools are district schools. The top performing schools have a smaller student population, while the bottom performing schools have a larger student population. The top performing schools have a higher budget per student, while the bottom performing schools have a lower budget per student. Based on these results, the school board should consider converting district schools to charter schools, reducing the student population at district schools, and increasing the budget per student at district schools.
